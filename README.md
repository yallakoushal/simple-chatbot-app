Project Overview

The Simple Chatbot is a beginner-friendly Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to interact with a basic conversational bot.
The chatbot can respond to simple user queries like greetings, date/time, or general responses.

This project showcases GUI design, event-driven programming, and basic AI-like logic using conditional statements — a fun way to start exploring artificial intelligence in Java!

✅ Predefined Responses
Handles greetings, questions about time/date, and other common phrases.

✅ Real-Time Display
Messages from both user and bot appear in a chat area.

✅ Clean and Simple UI
Built using Swing components (JFrame, JTextArea, JTextField, JScrollPane, and JButton).

✅ Lightweight & Offline
Doesn’t require internet — runs locally and fast.
